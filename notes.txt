Next Steps
===========
- Check Reward Signal: Ensure the agent is rewarded for meaningful progress.
- Experiment with Hyperparameters. Focus on: 
    - learning rate, e.g.,lr=1e-5 or lr=5e-5
    - gamma, e.g., 0.95, 0.98, or 0.99
    - epsilon decay increase e.g., 0.999 or
    - epsilon_start, increase e.g., 1.2
- Adjust delta value of loss function. (done)
- Add dropout layers
- Add more convolutional layers or increase the number of filters and neurons.
- Increase the update_every parameter or decrease the soft-update tau to make updates more gradual.

Results
========
Changing delta in loss function doesnt improve training
